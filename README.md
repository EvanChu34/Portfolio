# Portfolio

Attached is the first iteration of Evan Chu's working coding porfolio. Currently, the portfolio is very basic. It has three tabs of information: Home/About me, Portfolio, Contact me On the Home/About me tab, I have provided a bio of some information about myself. This includes education, current employment, and hobbies. On the next tab, Portfolio, there is 
a stack of images in a column. For now, there are only images used a placeholders, as I have yet to make any impressive projects. I will be replacing those placeholders with actual project websites. On the last page, there is space for a visitor fill out a form, giving the visitor's name, email and a small message. 

For now, the website is a work in progress and will be updated periodically with new information and new features. I always look for improvement, so let me know I should change anything or add something in.
