# Portfolio

Attached is the updated iteration of Evan Chu's working coding porfolio. Currently, the portfolio is basic, but it does have some updated code. It has three tabs of information: Home/About me, Portfolio, Contact me On the Home/About me tab, I have provided a bio of some information about myself. This includes education, current employment, and hobbies. On the next tab, Portfolio, there is 
a stack of images in a column. There are also titles of projects next to those images. Those are the projects that I have worked on in the pass few months. There are also buttons that will take the view to the project's Github and active pages. Currently, there are 6 project on the portfolio page. There will be more projects added on in the future. There is space for a visitor fill out a form, giving the visitor's name, email and a small message. This can be found on the contact page. Lastly,I've added links to my get Linked profile and a Google Doc. The Google Doc contains my resume so employers can look/download the resume. 

For now, the website is still a work in progress and will be updated periodically with new projects and new features. I always look for improvement, so let me know I should change anything or add something in.
